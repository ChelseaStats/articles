#### Gianfranco Zola.

Back then Chelsea were ok, nothing special, but just starting out on a glorious 20 years for the club. Zolaâ€™s impact was immediate en route to winning the FA Cup for the first time in 26 years. He was voted the FWA player of the year having only joined in November. Going on to score the winning goal in the European Cup Winners Cup final and giving Julian Dicks twisted blood are notable highlights. He gave us unprecedented quality.

One of the most memorable moments in turning Carragher inside out and leaving him on his backside beating another two Liverpool players in the process.

Its almost unheard of these days that a Chelsea player would be universally liked but his attitude and infectious smile made him special and different to most modern day footballers.
