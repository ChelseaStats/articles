###### Why Pulis’ Palace Could Stun Man Utd: Squawka PL Predictions

> By Damian BuxtonPosted on February 21, 2014

Palace v Manchester United
The latest round of Premier League fixtures sees all four of the Premier League’s top four playing at home, with any slip ups having the potential to be crucial to the tightest title race in years.

Arsenal and Manchester City will both be looking to put their midweek Champions League woe behind them with home fixtures against Sunderland and Stoke respectively, whilst league leaders Chelsea host Everton and Swansea City travel to Anfield to face Liverpool.

Chelsea v Everton
Squawka Dave
I think this could be another ruthless Chelsea win on the counter attack. They’re unbeaten at home this season, with 11 wins and two draws, and Hazard has been in brilliant goalscoring form recently.

Alongside Hazard, Willian has also been in great form. No other player in the league has created more chances than Willian (24) in 2014.

Nemanja Matic has played a large part in that. He looks to spread the ball quickly at every opportunity, which has benefited Hazard and Willian, and gives the midfield the physical presence it has been lacking.  Not only does he give the side strength in depth, but he also gives the physical presence that the team hasn’t had since the days of Essien, Ballack and Geremi.

Cesar Azpilicueta could also be key. Chelsea have lost just one of the 15 games in which he has played this season, while only Ramires (57) has made more tackles for Chelsea this season than Azpilicueta’s 46.

For Everton, Kevin Mirallas will be the key man. He has scored two free kicks in his last six games, eclipsing the rest of the league, and has created more chances than any other Everton player this season.

Score: 3-2
Chelsea Stats
Chelsea are dominant at home and have still not lost a league game at the Bridge under Mourinho (won 57 drawn 16). Everton beat us at Goodison earlier in the season, so Chelsea will look to avenge that result.

Chelsea haven’t lost at home to Everton in the league since 1994 but also haven’t kept a clean sheet against them for 13 games.

Score: 2-1
Stat:  Mirallas has created 49 chances in the Premier League this season. Only Hazard (65), Özil (63), Silva (61), Suarez (61) and Sissoko (60) have created more.

Arsenal v Sunderland
Squawka Dave
Arsenal were the better side before the game changing penalty against Bayern during the week, but looked dejected after it. Their second half display reminded me of how they looked at Liverpool and when they lost 8-2 to United, and I don’t think that they have the mental strength to win the title.

I’d also question their morale at the moment and think that they lack a leader. Flamini yelling at Ozil hinted at a side starting to crack and the Giroud affair can’t have helped things.

Sunderland, on the other hand, are in good form at the moment. Adam Johnson has six goals in 2014, more than every other player in the league bar Luis Suarez, whilst Ki has become a key player under Gus Poyet with his tidiness on the ball.

That said, I think Arsenal will win the game. If I were Wenger, I would play Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain centrally, as I think that Jack Wilshere is poor tactically and struggles to know when to press and when to sit.

Mesut Ozil and Santi Cazorla will be the key players for Arsenal. When on the ball, Ozil is Arsenal’s best player, while Cazorla has hit a good run of form this year.

Score: 2-1
Chelsea Stats
Arsenal will bounce back from their disappointment against Bayern and although i think Sunderland are better under Poyet, Arsenal will be too strong. Giroud has had a rest and will be the difference.

Score: 2-0
Stat: Santi Cazorla has made more passes in 2014 than any other Premier League player.

Cardiff v Hull
Chelsea Stats:
Cardiff look poor and haven’t had the boost a new manager brings on the flip side Hull have boosted their strike force and that looks to be Shrewd business.

Cardiff have won just  four of their 16 games against sides outside the big seven this season. Hull have won six. I think Hull will be too strong and win 0-2

Score: 0-2
Squawka Dave Predicts: 2-1.
Stat:  No team in the league have scored fewer goals than Hull in 2014 (3), whilst only three teams have scored fewer than Cardiff’s four goal tally (Hull, Norwich, Newcastle.)

Manchester City v Stoke City
Chelsea Stats
The 2011 Cup final. Hughes back at his former club. Man City like Arsenal will bounce back and although goals have dried up a little in recent games they will be back to their best this time.

Stoke have lost all five games away from home against the big teams, and although they beat Chelsea and Man Utd at home they won’t have enough to stop City’s fluidity

Score: 5-0
Squawka Dave Predicts: 3-1
Stat: Stoke have scored seven goals from set pieces this season. Despite their reputation, only three Premier League teams have managed fewer this season.

West Brom v Fulham
Chelsea Stats
Mel’s Baggies aren’t quite there yet but credible draws against Everton, Liverpool and Chelsea suggest they are good enough to survive, they’ve won just three of 16 games against sides outside the big seven, the worst record in the league.

Fulham are in all sorts of trouble.

Score: 2-0
Squawka Dave Predicts: 1-0
Stat: No side in Europe’s top five leagues this season has let in more goals than Fulham (58).

West Ham v Southampton
Chelsea Stats
Many would think West Ham have turned it around in recent weeks, but the truth is they have had easier games and they are a team good enough to finish around 10th. They have 13 clean sheets this season, but  six of those were 0-0 draws. Southampton have nothing to play for after their FA Cup loss.

West Ham will continue to secure their Premier League place but Southampton are decent enough and will score.

Score: 2-1
Squawka Dave Predicts: 2-0
Stat: West Ham are the only side in the Premier League to have picked up nine points from their past three games.

Crystal Palace v Manchester United
Squawka Dave:
Crystal Palace’s change of style under Tony Pulis should keep them up, as they’ve become more resilient and are sound defensively, but I think United will win this game.

However that will only happen if they get the ball on the deck, as if they approach this game in the same way as the Fulham game then it will play into Palace’s hands.

I think Moyes may need to sacrifice one of his three amigos going forward. The side looks more balanced with Valencia and Januzaj on the wings to spread the game and I would play Mata behind Robin Van Persie.

I would also play Rio Ferdinand for this game due to his calmness in possession. United have the fourth highest number of clearances in the league (1033), suggesting that they lack someone who can put their foot on the ball and pass it.

Score: 0-3
Chelsea Stats
Manchester United are where they are and it’s not surprising really. The attacking  four or five are fine, but they struggle in midfield and defence and the squad looks short. Palace have been solid under Pulis and I had predicted they would upset a big team at some point this season. This I think will be their day.

Score: 1-0
Stat: Only West Ham, Liverpool and Fulham have made more clearances than Manchester United in this season’s Premier League.

Liverpool v Swansea
Squawka Dave:
I can’t see Liverpool not winning this one. Their form is outstanding and the balance of the side has started to click. Suarez is key to making the side tick, from central or wide, as everything goes through him.

I also think Jordan Henderson has been brilliant of late and is becoming a top player. Damien Comolli is said to have signed him due to his running and ability to create chances from open play and that is becoming evident this season.

Swansea’s squad looks too light to be in the Europa League and Premier League to me, and I think they could suffer a European hangover. They’ve looked better under Gary Monk, who understands the club, and I think that their passing looks more penetrative in recent weeks – with Leon Britton the key man again –  than it did under Michael Laudrup, whose side had looked stale in possession.

Laudrup came in and built on Brendan Rodgers’ work, but then struggled to sustain it. He has been similar at other clubs and I think his record suggests that he is an impact manger. A Danish Martin Allen.

Score: 4-1
Chelsea Stats
Suarez failed to score against Arsenal, yet the team scored 5 and look to be one of the form sides at the moment, I can’t help but think they’ll pip Arsenal to finish in the top three.

Monk seems like a good fit for Swansea as he gets the club. Is he good enough to keep them in the league and take them to the next level, I’m not sure, regardless they won’t get anything in this one.

Score: 3-0
Stat: Jordan Henderson has created 48 chances this season. Only Luis Suarez has created more among Liverpool’s players.

Henderson has created more chances than Gerrard and Coutinho
Newcastle v Aston Villa
Chelsea Stats
Newcastle are another side with nothing left to play for, they’ve conceded 10 in the last three games and have only scored in one of their last eight games. Villa have won just two of their last 12 and one of those was their cup final against West Brom. I think this has 0-0 written all over it.

Score: 0-0
Squakwa Dave Predicts: 0-0
Stat: Aston Villa have scored three times as many goals in 2014 (9) than Newcastle (3).

Norwich v Tottenham
Squawka Dave
This game could also see the remnants of a Europa league hangover and I think that Tottenham will make a sluggish start to the game. However Emmanuel Adebayor has been brilliant of late and I think he can prove the difference.

He has a chance conversion rate of 47%, better than any other player to have scored more than five goals in the Premier League this season.

Score: 1-2
Chelsea Stats
Norwich have won just one of their last 11 in the league and Spurs have turned the corner from Andre Villas-Boas with Sherwood, like Monk I’m not sure he’s the long term solution, but he will keep them in the top seven this season.

Spurs are decent away from home too, with the most wins in the league, they’ve lost just two and will be too strong for Norwich.

Score: 0-2
Stat: Without Emmanuel Adebayor’s goals, Tottenham would be seven points worse off this season.
